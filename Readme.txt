The python notebook is recommended to be run in Google Colab with internet connection. As the datasets are being pulled directly from the URLs from github. I will also attach the original csv files, without preprocessing for redundancy. 

How to run:
Run each cell one after the other from the beginning. 
Outputs may already be visible as it is a python notebook, and as such, any new results might vary slightly but should relatively be close to what's in the report. 
There is no need to run the 2 cells, where Google drive is mounted and the combined_df dataframe is saved. This is just for ease. 


The models are in seperate cells in the following order:
Model with cases only
Hypertuned model with cases only
Model with cases and vaccinations
Hypertuned model with cases and vaccinations
Model with cases, vaccinations and deaths
Hypertuned model with cases, vaccinations and deaths
